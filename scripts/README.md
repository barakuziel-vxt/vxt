# Scripts

Developer convenience scripts live in the repo root:

- `start_all.ps1` — start services locally (Windows PowerShell)
- `run_sql_script.py` — helper to run SQL files against the configured DB
- `run_api.py` / `serve_flask.py` — run API services

If you add more scripts, keep them small and add usage examples here.
