# Dashboards

Two front-end dashboards are included:

- `boat-dashboard/` — Vite / React app
- `health-dashboard/` — another React app

Run (per dashboard):
1. `cd boat-dashboard`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` (or `npm start` if configured)

Build for production:
- `npm run build`

Notes:
- Static builds can be served with the `build/` contents (already committed for `boat-dashboard`).
