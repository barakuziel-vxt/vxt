# DB Seeds

This folder is reserved for seed and test data for local development.

Place small CSV/SQL files here to load sample data into your dev database. For example:
- `initial_customers.sql`
- `sample_boat_234567890.sql`

Note: Keep seed files idempotent or provide instructions for usage in this README.
